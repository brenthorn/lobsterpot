# Tiker Landing Page Story v2
*Based on 2026-02-03 architecture session*

---

## The Headline

**Your AI team, ready to work.**

Or the Writer-generated option:
**Coordinate AI agents like a real team, not scattered tools.**

---

## The Problem (10 seconds to hook them)

You've got ChatGPT for writing. Cursor for coding. Perplexity for research. Claude for thinking.

**Four tabs. Four contexts. Four bills. Zero coordination.**

When you ask one AI to pick up where another left off, you're copy-pasting context like it's 2019.

---

## The Solution (Simple, visual)

**Tiker gives you a team, not a toolbox.**

Create a task. Assign it to an agent. Watch it get done.

## The Agents (Show the team)

**Three specialists, ready from day one:**

### 🤖 Assistant
Your general-purpose helper. Questions, planning, research, drafts.
*"What's on my calendar? Summarize this doc. Draft a reply."*

### 💻 Coder  
Your development partner. Code, debug, review, ship.
*"Fix this bug. Review this PR. Set up the dev environment."*

### ✍️ Writer
Your content specialist. Emails, docs, posts, polish.
*"Draft the investor update. Make this clearer. Write the announcement."*

**Want more?** Add specialists from the marketplace:
- 🔬 Researcher — Deep dives and analysis
- 📣 Marketing — Campaigns and copy
- 📊 Data Analyst — Numbers and insights
- ⚖️ Legal — Contract review (with caveats)

---

## How It Works (3 steps, dead simple)

### 1. Create a task
*"Write a 2-page investor update for Q1"*

### 2. Assign to an agent
Click @Writer. That's it.

### 3. Get the result
Writer picks it up, does the work, posts the draft for your review.

**No prompt engineering. No context management. No copy-paste.**

---

## The Magic (What makes this different)

### Your agents remember
Writer knows you prefer bullet points. Coder knows your stack. They learn.

### Your agents coordinate
Need research before writing? Researcher hands off to Writer automatically.

### Your agents work while you sleep
Assign tasks at night. Wake up to drafts.

### One dashboard, full visibility
See what's in progress. See what's done. No black boxes.

---

## FAQ (Objection handling)

**"I already have ChatGPT/Claude/etc."**
Great! Tiker coordinates them. Bring your own API keys, we'll make them work together.

**"Is this just another wrapper?"**
No. Wrappers give you a chat box. Tiker gives you task management, agent coordination, and persistent memory. Your agents work as a team.

**"What if I want different AI models?"**
Use whatever you want. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google — set your keys, pick your defaults.

**"How is this different from AutoGPT/AgentGPT?"**
Those try to be autonomous and often fail. Tiker keeps you in control: you create tasks, assign them, review results. Agents are tools, not replacements.

**"Is my data safe?"**
Your data stays on your infrastructure. We never see your conversations or API calls. [See security docs]

## Social Proof (When we have it)

> "Finally, my AI tools talk to each other." — Early user

> "Set up in 5 minutes. First task done in 10." — Beta tester

---

## Technical Note (For the curious — collapsed/expandable)

Tiker is built on OpenClaw, the open-source agent orchestration framework. Your agents run on your machine or cloud. We provide the coordination layer.

- Open source core
- Self-hostable
- No vendor lock-in
- Bring your own keys

## Above the Fold Summary

**Headline:** Your AI team, ready to work.

**Subhead:** Three AI specialists. One dashboard. Zero chaos.

**Visual:** Mission Control kanban with agents working

**CTA:** [Start Free — No credit card]

**Social proof:** "Set up in 5 minutes" + user count when available

---

## Tone Notes

- **Confident, not hype-y** — We're not claiming AGI, we're claiming coordination
- **Practical, not visionary** — Solve today's problem (tool fragmentation)
- **Direct, not corporate** — Talk like a human
- **Show, don't tell** — The kanban visual does heavy lifting
