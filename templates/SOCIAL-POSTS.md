# Tweet Variations for Soft Launch

## Option 1: Problem-Focused

> Tired of juggling 5 AI tabs?
> 
> ChatGPT for writing. Claude for thinking. Cursor for coding. Perplexity for research.
> 
> Zero coordination between them.
> 
> So we built Tiker — Command for your AI team.
> 
> Create tasks. Assign to agents. Watch them get done.
> 
> Solo is free. Team is $7/mo.
> 
> First 100 users get 3 months free.
> 
> 🚀 tiker.com

## Option 2: Solution-Focused

> Your AI team, ready to work.
> 
> Tiker gives you:
> • One dashboard for all your AI agents
> • Task assignments (like a real team)
> • Persistent memory (no more re-explaining)
> • Async work (wake up to results)
> 
> Not another chatbot. A task board for AI workers.
> 
> Soft launching now — rough edges expected, feedback welcome.
> 
> tiker.com

> But one dashboard where you assign tasks, track progress, and get results.
> 
> That's Tiker.
> 
> Soft launching today. First 100 users get 3 months free.
