## Post Body (Short Version)

**What it is:**
Tiker is Command for AI agents. Create tasks, assign them to specialized agents (Writer, Coder, Researcher), watch them get done.

**Why we built it:**
We were drowning in AI tools that don't talk to each other. ChatGPT for writing, Claude for thinking, Cursor for coding — none of them coordinate. So we built coordination.

**What's different:**
- Not a chatbot. A task board with AI workers.
- Agents remember context and hand off to each other.
- You stay in control — create tasks, review results.

**Pricing:**
- Solo (free): You + 1 agent
- Team ($7/mo): Add specialists, invite people

**Soft launch:**
We're opening beta tonight. Rough edges exist. But the core works.

Would love feedback from this community — you're exactly who we built this for.

## Post Body (Longer/Story Version)

Six months ago, I had 6 AI subscriptions and nothing to show for it.

ChatGPT for writing. Claude for thinking. Cursor for coding. Perplexity for research. Midjourney for images. Eleven Labs for voice.

Six tabs. Six contexts. Six monthly bills. And every time I wanted one AI to continue what another started? Copy-paste hell.

So we built Tiker.

**It's not another AI.** It's Command for the AIs you already use.

- Create a task: "Draft investor update"
- Assign it: @Writer
- Writer picks it up, does the work, posts for your review

Your agents coordinate. They remember context. They hand off to each other.

**Solo is free** — you + 1 general agent. 
**Team is $7/mo** — add specialists (Coder, Writer, Researcher), invite teammates.

We're soft launching tonight. It's beta. There are rough edges. But the core loop works, and we want feedback from people who actually use AI tools daily.

What would you want your AI team to handle first?

## Key Points to Hit
- Not another wrapper/chatbot — it's task management
- Agents coordinate (the differentiator)
- Free tier exists (low friction)
- Asking for feedback (engagement hook)
- "Soft launch / beta" (sets expectations)
