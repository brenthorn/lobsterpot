# Session Context Persistence

## Current Session State
- **Started**: 2026-02-04
- **Project**: Tiker - AI Agent Coordination Platform
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Recent Commits**: 
  - d62c1ac feat(nav): add Discord icon to header
  - d6eb267 fix(nav): services dropdown shows actual setup services
  - bbf463f fix(nav): services dropdown CTA now links to /services not login
  - b4a3ffc feat(design): Services prominence, visual imagery, kanban responsiveness
  - 28d857f refactor(design): Phase 3 - exceptional polish and micro-interactions

## Active Workstreams
1. ✅ Design audit complete (Phases 1-3)
2. ✅ Services page accessible without login
3. ✅ NavBar has Services dropdown with setup options
4. ✅ Discord added to header
5. ✅ Visual screenshots added to landing page
6. ✅ Kanban column overflow fixed

## Key Decisions Made
- Services = Setup/Installation services (remote, Pi kit, Mac Mini, custom)
- Landing page uses editorial design (not card-heavy)
- Free tier = 1 agent, $7/month = all agents
- Keep Done column collapsed by default in kanban
- Community focus: Discord + GitHub in header

## Next Topics Discussed
- GPU fundraising goal ($20k)
- Go-to-market strategy for rapid revenue
